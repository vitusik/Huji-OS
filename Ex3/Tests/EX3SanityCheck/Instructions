-----------------------------Sanity Test------------------------------
_______________________________________________________________________

1. Copy your ex3.tar to the same folder you extracted the sanity test.
   Make sure that there are no other files in there.
2. In shell, "cd" into this folder.
3. Write: "test" in the shell and press enter. It will run the test.
4. If the output is "Passed presubmission" - you are fine.
5. Otherwise, the test prints "Failed presubmission" and the reason for the failure.
   Fix the problem and run the test again.
