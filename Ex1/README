None.

Task 1:
The program WhatIDo has to recieve one argument which can be a number or a 
string,then the program creates in the current working directory a directory
name "Welcome", inside that directory it creates another one named "To", 
each dir created with owner + group full permissions, and others can only 
read and execute inside that it creates and opens a file name "OS2016" with 
read+write permissions for everyone, if the file already exists then the 
program overwrites that file, after that writes to a buffer info about the 
file, after that it writes to it 184 chars + the length of the given argument,
after that it closes the file, deletes the file, and all of the directories it 
has created, and then terminates all the threads that were created in the 
programs process.

system calls that helped understand the program:
mkdir - creates a dir, receives path and optional mode which sets the dir 
		permissions.
rmdir - removes a dir, receives path to the dir.
open - opens and possibly creates a file, recieves path and optional flags 
		and mode.
unlink - deletes a name and possibly the file it refers to.
fstat - receives a path to a file and a pointer to stat structure which 
		holds info about the file
exit_group - exits and terminates all threads in the process 

Task 2:
All of the messure time functions use loop unrolling.
